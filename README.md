# KeySenderClient
A JavaFX program that allows players to send key event datas to minecraft server.

In Minecraft game we can not listen all keys but certain ones.
What I wanted to achieve was to listen all keys when pressed and send it to the minecraft server
so developers can listen to other keys and put function on them.
